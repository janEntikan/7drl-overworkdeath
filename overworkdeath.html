Plot

You are a salary-man working on a very high floor in a highly advanced office-building, who's automated computer systems seemed to have gone postal on your colleagues. You need to escape the building, floor by floor, fighting off hoards of security drones, a group of terrorists and even otherworldly beings. How high even is this building and what is left of the world once you get out?

Technicalities
  - Using Git Version control, pushing to GitHub.
  - Game-logic will be written entirely in python with Panda3d using classes where possible.
  - Game-board will be a 32x32 grid of lists  (so 32 lists with 32 lists of lists) filled with tile_class.
  - The “node” part of a tile-class is the only panda3d related part of these classes preferably.
  - Each model is only loaded once.
  - Graphics, low-poly,  made in Blender, exported as an Egg-file.
    - worst case, draw images using the line-tool in ms-paint, single color
      for hobo to trace them in blender
  - String tables of story/logs, descriptions, etc.  as spreadsheet saved as .CSV like so:

| some_catagory_name           |                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unique_name_of_string_coffee | This is the actual string as description of an item. Hmm! Tasty coffee!     |
| another_unique_ID_log124     | This is some string which is story told through a log or whatever. Help me! |
| termos_description           | A sturdy, vacuum sealed thermos. Who even knows what’s inside?              |

  - Music rendered using soundfonts and therefore can be any midi-file, exported as .OGG.
  - Sound-fx probably using simple FM-synthesizers, exported as .WAV.
Graphics
  - first person dungeoncrawler-esque rogue-like
  - wire-frame characters for text
  - wire-frame 3d surroundings
  - line-tool/vector billboard enemies/creatures
  - fluid movement/instant input response (unlike some roguelikes)

Map generation
At least
  Preheat oven at 220 degrees.
  - Divide map into 9 parts.
  - In each part, carve out a randomly sized room, at least 3 tiles smaller then the part.
  - Connect the rooms randomly with hallways.
  - With the rest of the tiles, run simple maze generation, connecting to rooms and hallways randomly.
  - At dead ends add doors and keys.
  - In each room place furniture and wall orns.
  - In hallways add wall and ceiling orns.
  - Sprinkle with enemies.
  - Each room a simple maze of cubicles.
  Let it rest and harden in the fridge for 3 hours.
If time permits
  Lobby algorithms every 3 floors?
  Cantine/Leisure floors?
Audio
  Music written in florestan or opl3?
  Sound fx should be simple noise and oscilations type affair. Perhaps FM?
Sounds
  - Player step (tick/plonk)
  - Enemy step (lower tick/plonk)
  - Melee hit (thonk! slash!)
  - Ranged hit (pew!)
  - Enemy death (perhaps multiple or one per type?)
  - Stairs (step step step, lower in pitch each time)
  - Elevator (DING!)
  - Consume sound (gulp!)
  - Wield (click-click)
  Probably a lot more.

  - Menu music
  - Level music (one song looping in different intensities again? else about 3 songs)
  - End level music (short chill elevator music loop?)
  - Game-over/End credits song
